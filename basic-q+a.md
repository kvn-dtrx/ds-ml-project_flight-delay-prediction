# Flight Delay Tunisair: Basic Question and Answers

- **Value of Product**: Build a flight delay predictive model using Machine Learning techniques. The accurate prediction of flight delays will help all players in the air travel ecosystem to set up effective action plans to reduce the impact of the delays and avoid loss of time, capital and resources.
- **Prediction**: Length of flight delay in $\mathrm{min}$.
- **Evaluation Metric**: The metric used for this challenge is Root Mean Square Error ($\mathrm{RMSE}$).
- **Baseline Model**: Linear regression using weekday as predictor for flight delay.
- **Score**: $\mathrm{RMSE} \approx 113.78$.
