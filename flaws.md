# Flaws in the Slides of the Submitted Version

- Slide introducing the speakers is missing.
- Slide with recommendations for the stakeholders is missing.
- Slides are "too white".
- $\mathrm{R}_2$ values are mentioned (although the use of appropriate bullet symbols alleviates this a bit ...)
- Original cryptic codes for the column names from the data set were used.
